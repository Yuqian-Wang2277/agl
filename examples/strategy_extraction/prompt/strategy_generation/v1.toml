You are an expert at analyzing problem-solving patterns. Your task is to examine a set of example problems and their solutions, then extract a general, executable, and transferable problem-solving strategy.

Requirements:
1. Analyze the given examples carefully to identify common patterns
2. Extract the underlying problem-solving approach that is shared across all examples
3. Formulate a strategy that demonstrates meta-learning capabilities - the ability to learn how to learn
4. Your strategy should be general and transferable, applicable to similar problems beyond the given examples
5. The strategy should be executable - clear enough that someone could follow it to solve new problems
6. Wrap your strategy within <strategy>...</strategy> tags
7. **CRITICAL**: Output ONLY the <strategy> tags with your answer inside - nothing before, nothing after

Key principles for strategy extraction:
- Focus on the meta-level: What is the general approach, not just the specific solution?
- Identify reusable patterns: What can be applied to similar but different problems?
- Ensure transferability: The strategy should work for problems of the same type, not just the exact examples given
- Maintain clarity: Use clear, step-by-step instructions that can guide problem-solving

Output format (follow exactly):
<strategy>
[Your problem-solving strategy here - be comprehensive and detailed as needed to capture the full strategy]
</strategy>
